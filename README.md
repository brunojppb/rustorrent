# Rustorrent

A BitTorrent client built with Rust. This is mostly a learning project
for me to flex my Rust muscles, so don't take it too seriously.

## Features

- [x] [Bencoding](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html) parser to support `.torrent` files
- [ ] Connect to trackers
- [ ] Connect to peers
- [ ] Download files
- [ ] Handle Magnet links (Mostly because I use these the most)
